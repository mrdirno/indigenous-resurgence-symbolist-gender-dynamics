## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a modern character receives a 'useless' ancestral object (like the bone comb) and must decipher its warning.
- Create a dialogue between a person who 'listens' to the land and a person who sees it only as resource. Do they find common ground?
- Imagine a ritual where women use everyday items (cakes, woven patterns, hearth stones) to perform a protective act against an unseen corporate threat.
- Write from the perspective of the mountain (K'acha) as it experiences the intrusion of the machine and the approach of the listener.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map where users can 'listen' to different points on a landscape, each triggering a fragment of story, song, or environmental data.
- Create a text generator that weaves a narrative by combining prompts about 'ritual objects', 'environmental threats', and 'intergenerational dialogue'.
- Design a web experience where scrolling mimics Kaya's journey uphill, with the background audio shifting from river sounds to a distorted mechanical hum.
